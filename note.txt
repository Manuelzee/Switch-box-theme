First, create a button that will be used to toggle between the dark and light theme. You can do this using HTML.

Next, create two sets of CSS styles, one for the light theme and one for the dark theme. You can do this by using the :root pseudo-class to define global variables for the color values, and then using those variables in your styles.

Then, add a JavaScript function that will be called when the theme switch button is clicked. This function should toggle a class on the <html> element to switch between the light and dark themes.
